STEP 1
Preheat oven to 350oF (175o C).

Melt butter in the microwave or on the stovetop.

Lightly grease a 9x13 baking dish with the paper from the butter.

STEP 2
Turn on your scale, and place the bowl for your sugar on it.  Tare the scale so it reads 0g.  Pour in the sugar until it reaches 600g.  

Repeat for the flour and cocoa.  You can tare the scale again after adding the flour and before adding the cocoa, but I just added the numbers together to get the weight I'd need.  

Whisk flour and cocoa together with soda and salt.  

STEP 3
Combine the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl.

Mix!

STEP 4
Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each, until thoroughly blended.

STEP 5
Gradually stir in the flour and cocoa mixture on low speed.  

STEP 6
Toss the chocolate chips in a light dusting of flour, and stir into the mix with a spoon or spatula.

The flour will keep them suspended in the batter and prevent them from all sinking to the bottom!

STEP 7
Pour into prepared pan.

Spread the batter in the pan, slightly mounding on the sides so it will all bake evenly (avoiding the typical mound you get in the middle after baking).

Bake for 35-40 minutes.

STEP 8 (the final step)
The brownies are done when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.

ENJOY!!!
